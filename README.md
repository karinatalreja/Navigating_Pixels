The Virual Mouse Project
##ABSTRACT
The virtual mouse, a software-based emulation of the traditional computer mouse, has become a pivotal tool in modern computing environments. This abstract explores the significance, functionality, and applications of virtual mice in the context of software development and user interaction.
In the field of game development, virtual mice are instrumental in creating engaging and interactive gaming experiences. By using Python and other programming languages, game developers can simulate mouse interactions that allow players to control in-game characters, navigate complex environments, and interact with objects.

##INTRODUCTION
This type of virtual mouse system is typically developed using the Python programming language, and computer vision projects also employ the OpenCV package. The system makes use of well-known Python libraries like MediaPipe for the real-time tracking of hands and finger movements. The PyAutoGUI package is also used to track the finger as it moves across the screen to perform actions like left- and right-clicking, dragging, and scrolling. This also makes use of Numpy for calculations.
